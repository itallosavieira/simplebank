## Project designed to practice the following topics
* Vanilla JS
* Object Oriented Paradigm



## Reflection

The objectives of the project included using some new concepts learned to this point and familiarizing myself with this new knowledges.

I wanted to build an application with simple banking functions Iike deposit, transfer, withdraw, and a login authentication system for employees.

One of the main challenges I encountered was put into practice what I learned about the Objected-oriented Paradigm with JS. This led me to spend a few hours on research on it.

Ultimately, this project was made with only VanillaJS.
